Beans-Vs-Beans
==============
Beans Vs Beans is a weird FPS game made in Unity, by CliffracerX!

This is a WIP and likely to have some weird bugs, but has decently simple controls and basic gameplay.

* 1, 2, and 3 let you take out your 3 different guns (keep an eye on your ammo count in the top left corner)
* Left mouse button shoots (if you have ammo left, that is)
* R reloads
* WASD for movement
* Mouse for looking around

You'll need to do some portforwarding to host a server, and to connect to a server you refresh the serverlist with the "refresh hosts" button, then if a new button (or multiple new buttons) appears, click to join the server!

The settings are below the start/refresh buttons, with 4 textboxes for the server name, server port, max players, and then for direct-connecting with the button on the right, the 4th textbox is the direct IP.

Music is by Kevin MacLeod, here's his site: http://incompetech.com/music/

Sounds are from freesound most of the time (with the exception of the death noise and 3rd gun fire noise), check the UnityFiles/Assets/Sound/Attribution.txt file for more.

All assets are either made by me or from the Unity Standard Assets.
