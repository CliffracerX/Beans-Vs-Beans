This is a weird FPS made by CliffracerX!\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in playing it, click the link for your platform (sorry mac users, haven't got a mac to test with so I'm putting mac support on hold) down below, following the pattern of OSname-32/64bit (x86=32 bit)  Warning - this is likely rather buggy!\r\n\r\n* [Windows x86](https://github.com/CliffracerX/Beans-Vs-Beans/releases/download/alpha0.1/Windowsx86.zip)\r\n* [Windows x64](https://github.com/CliffracerX/Beans-Vs-Beans/releases/download/alpha0.1/Windowsx64.zip)\r\n* [Linux x86](https://github.com/CliffracerX/Beans-Vs-Beans/releases/download/alpha0.1/Linuxx86.zip)\r\n* [Linux x64](https://github.com/CliffracerX/Beans-Vs-Beans/releases/download/alpha0.1/Linuxx64.zip)\r\n\r\nThe default controls are:\r\nWASD/Arrow keys for movement\r\nLeft mouse button/Left Control for firing your gun\r\nR for reloading your gun\r\nESC for freeing your mouse cursor\r\n1, 2, and 3 for taking out your 3 guns (look at the ammo counter in the top left)\r\n\r\nTo hop on a server if one is up, hit \"refresh hosts\" and click any new buttons that appear to join those servers.\r\n\r\nGameplay consists of a weird team deathmatch on a weird map, with some interior areas and outdoor platforms (on top of a layer of deadly goo), a red player's death is a blue point, and a blue player's death is a red point.  Whichever team reaches the point goal first wins!  There are ammo crates/medkits around the map to find and loot.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
